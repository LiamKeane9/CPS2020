        <h3>Backround</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Liam and I am the person on the left of the above picture. To my right are my two older sisters, Brenna and Lily.<p>
        <p>I am 17 years old, and I attend SHS. I enjoy running Cross Country and Track, playing games, and hanging with friends.<p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>My goals this year are fairly simple. I want to get through it. 
        Between COVID and college admissions, my year is looking to be busy. Despite this I will try to get the most out of it.<p>
        <h3>Music and Shows</h3>
        <p>Beastie Boys!<p>
        <img src="Me/Beasties.jpg" height="200">
        <p>I listen to them almost ritually. Although I understand they are not for everyone (My mom included), I firmly believe they are one of the most creative, entertaining music groups<p></p>
